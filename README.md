## ðŸ§¾ Assignment Breakdown

### ðŸ”¹ Question 1: Banking System [25 Marks]
Create a banking system using an abstract class and inheritance.

#### âœ… Files:
- `Bank.java`: Abstract class with `accountName`, `balance`, and abstract methods `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `getBalance()`.
- `Account.java`: Implements `Bank`. Handles deposits, withdrawals (with balance checks), and balance retrieval.
- `test_account.java`: Tests all banking operations.
- `Bank.txt`: Stores transaction logs in the root directory.

#### ðŸ’¡ Features:

- Accepts only positive deposit amounts.
- Logs all transactions to `Bank.txt`.

#### a. Stream Filtering [10 Marks]
